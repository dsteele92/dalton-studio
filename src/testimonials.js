	Andrew: `Last January I committed to making personal fitness a lifestyle. Since all-around
    physical wellness was a priority, I wanted to practice routines that incorporated more
    than just weight training and cardio. I wanted to adapt yoga, bodyweight training and
    meditation as well. My goal was to improve everything from strength, power, flexibility,
    balance, core stability, and endurance, all the way to breathing and mindfulness. Since
    previous injuries and motivation are key issues with me, I decided I needed to work with
    a personal trainer. Someone who would keep me accountable, motivated, as well as teach
    me how to achieve my goals safely and correctly. <br />
    Fast forward… It’s been a year and I can honestly say I’m in the best shape of my entire
    life. Dalton and I continue to train 3 times a week and rarely skip or miss a session.
    What’s the secret you ask? Results. Plain and simple (and he’s a hell of a lot of fun).
    This talented young man knows exactly how to keep me moving. We rarely do the same
    routine twice. He develops customized programs that incorporate a little bit of
    everything. This guy is constantly introducing new equipment and exercises. One thing I
    can say for sure… Dalton Steele keeps it fresh. <br />
    His genuine interest, expertise and commitment to my well-being are ever present. So,
    although I never know what we’re going to do next, I trust it’s going to push me to that
    next level. I trust it’s going to deliver that stronger, happier and healthier man I
    committed to becoming a year ago. <br />
    With Dalton’s help, I’m living my dream. It’s a beautiful thing.`,
	Vijay: `I had a skiing accident in January 2020 where I broke my femur. Due to my accident, I lost strength, stamina, and mobility and I spent much of 2020 recovering. Since I started my training with Dalton in the Winter of 2020, I recovered so much faster. Dalton’s knowledge of the body and holistic approach to training has gotten me to the best shape of my life, even before my injury. Dalton offers a complete program that focuses on exercise, nutrition, mindfulness and mobility.
    Exercise: The exercises Dalton prepares are structured and well planned. Each week Dalton and I spend one day focusing on a different part of the body. One day each for metabolic training (jumping squats, stability push ups, etc), upper body (dips, pull ups, rows) and lower body (deadlifts, squats, lunges). Dalton also makes sure each subsequent workout pushes you so that you are on track to hit your goals. I started seeing strengths gains within two weeks of starting with him.
    Nutrition: Nutrition is also another important component to Dalton’s program; he assists with meal tracking and with his deep knowledge of nutrition he is able to provide ideas for meals as well as goals to hit to keep a balanced diet.
    Mindfulness: Every weekday Dalton starts each day holding at least 15 minutes to meditate. The meditation sessions have been a great way for me to enhance my self awareness and reduce daily stress.
    Mobility: Aside from getting stronger, Dalton holds a class once a week on mobility. The class goes through a bunch of stretches that help with range of movement and agility.
    I really appreciate the work Dalton has done to get me to where I am both physically and mentally. I would highly recommend Dalton to anyone looking for a trainer.`,
